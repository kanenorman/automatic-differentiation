## Broader Impact and Inclusivity Statement

### Broader Impact

Automatic differentiation is a powerful tool with the potential to have a broad impact across a range of fields. In particular, it has the potential to greatly accelerate research and development in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, where it can be used to more efficiently and effectively train complex models.

Beyond its applications in these fields, automatic differentiation also has the potential to benefit other areas of science and engineering that rely on the solution of complex optimization problems. This includes fields such as computational biology, finance, and physics, among others.

Furthermore, the development and widespread adoption of automatic differentiation techniques has the potential to promote inclusivity and equality in the field of computer science. By making it easier and more efficient to develop and train complex models, automatic differentiation can help to level the playing field and provide opportunities for individuals and communities who may have previously been excluded from the field due to the time and resources required to develop these models.

We are excited about the potential impact of our work on automatic differentiation and look forward to seeing the ways in which it may benefit the broader world.

### Inclusivity Statement

As a community, we are dedicated to creating an inclusive and welcoming space for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. We value and respect the unique experiences and perspectives of every member of our community, and we strive to create an environment where everyone feels safe, supported, and able to fully participate. 

Another important aspect of inclusivity is making sure that underrepresented groups are represented and included in the community. This includes individuals from marginalized backgrounds or communities, such as people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and others. It's important to actively seek out and include the voices and perspectives of these individuals in the community, and to provide support and accommodations to ensure that they can fully participate. This can be done through outreach efforts, by providing resources and support specifically for these individuals, and by creating a welcoming and inclusive environment that makes everyone feel valued and respected. By taking these steps, we can help create a community that is truly inclusive and representative of all its members.

We are excited to work together to build a vibrant and diverse community that celebrates the contributions of all individuals. Thank you for joining us on this journey.
